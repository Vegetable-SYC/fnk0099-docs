In this chapter, we will introduce how ESP32-S3 WROOM implements network communications based on TCP/IP protocol. There are two roles in TCP/IP communication, namely Server and Client, which will be implemented respectively with two projects in this chapter.

Project 6.1 As Client
*********************************

In this section, ESP32-S3 WROOM is used as Client to connect Server on the same LAN and communicate with it.

Component knowledge
=============================

TCP connection
-----------------------------

Before transmitting data, TCP needs to establish a logical connection between the sending end and the receiving end. It provides reliable and error-free data transmission between the two computers. In the TCP connection, the client and the server must be clarified. The client sends a connection request to the server, and each time such a request is proposed, a "three-times handshake" is required.

Three-times handshake: In the TCP protocol, during the preparation phase of sending data, the client and the server interact three times to ensure the reliability of the connection, which is called "three-times handshake".

The first handshake, the client sends a connection request to the server and waits for the server to confirm.

The second handshake, the server sends a response back to the client informing that it has received the connection request.

The third handshake, the client sends a confirmation message to the server again to confirm the connection.

TCP is a connection-oriented, low-level transmission control protocol. After TCP establishes a connection, the client and server can send and receive messages to each other, and the connection will always exist as long as the client or server does not initiate disconnection. Each time one party sends a message, the other party will reply with an ack signal.

Install Processing
------------------------------

In this tutorial, we use Processing to build a simple TCP/IP communication platform.

If you've not installed Processing, you can download it by clicking https://processing.org/download/. You can choose an appropriate version to download according to your PC system.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/6_TCP_IP/Chapter06_02.png
    :align: center

Unzip the downloaded file to your computer. Click "processing.exe" as the figure below to run this software.

Use Server mode for communication
------------------------------------------

Install ControlP5.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/6_TCP_IP/Chapter06_04.png
    :align: center

Open the "Freenove_ESP32_S3_WROOM_Board_Lite\\Sketches\\Sketches\\Sketch_06.1_WiFiClient\\sketchWiFi\\sketchWiFi.pde", and click "Run".

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/6_TCP_IP/Chapter06_05.png
    :align: center

The new pop-up interface is as follows. If ESP32-S3 WROOM is used as client, select TCP SERVER mode for sketchWiFi.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/6_TCP_IP/Chapter06_06.png
    :align: center

When sketchWiFi selects TCP SERVER mode, ESP32-S3 WROOM Sketch needs to be changed according to sketchWiFi's displaying of LOCAL IP or LOCAL PORT.

If ESP32-S3 WROOM serves as server, select TCP CLIENT mode for sketchWiFi.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/6_TCP_IP/Chapter06_07.png
    :align: center

When sketchWiFi selects TCP CLIENT mode, the LOCAL IP and LOCAL PORT of sketchWiFi need to be changed according to the IP address and port number printed by the serial monitor.

**Mode selection:** select **Server mode/Client mode.**

**IP address:** In server mode, this option does not need to be filled in, and the computer will automatically obtain the IP address.

                In client mode, fill in the remote IP address to be connected.

**Port number:** In server mode, fill in a port number for client devices to make an access connection. 

                In client mode, fill in port number given by the Server devices to make an access connection.

**Start button:** In server mode, push the button, then the computer will serve as server and open a port number for client to make access connection. During this period, the computer will keep monitoring.

                In client mode, before pushing the button, please make sure the server is on, remote IP address and remote port number is correct; push the button, and the computer will make access connection to the remote port number of the remote IP as a client. 

**clear receive:** clear out the content in the receiving text box

**clear send:** clear out the content in the sending text box

**Sending button:** push the sending button, the computer will send the content in the text box to others.
